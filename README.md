# rover_drive_controller
An experimental CANopen-based ROS motor controller for the Stanford Mars Rover

rover_drive_controller is an in-progress attempt to integrate four C5-E motor controllers and four massive brushless DC motors into a single functional rover. For references in developing this project, the ROS Wiki is an incredible help. Most of the configuration thus far has been closely based on [canopen_test_utils](https://github.com/ipa320/canopen_test_utils) and [schunk_robots](https://github.com/ipa320/schunk_robots).
